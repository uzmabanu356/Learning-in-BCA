        <h1>1. Weddings</h1>
        <p>hat movie may or may not secretly be the reason more than a handful of event coordinators and event management professionals got into the field in the first place, but ultimately that’s beside the point. The point is we all know weddings constitute events, and that a lot of people who have them decide to hire professional event managers to coordinate them.</p>

        <h1>2. BIRTHDAYS</h1>
        <p>Whether it’s a surprise party, or a formal catered affair for a milestone birthday, event managers love to coordinate a good birthday party.

            From bar or bat mitzvahs, to quinceaneras, sweet sixteens and twenty-firsts, most of us celebrate our coming of age with a birthday party at one point or another.
            
            A birthday party, like a wedding, is typically a celebration attended by family and friends, and it is a lovely opportunity to spoil the people in your life by inviting them to attend your perfectly coordinated and managed event.
            
            Electing to have an event manager handle your private event like a wedding, or a birthday party gives you as host the opportunity to sit back and relax on the day of and to enjoy your party, instead of running around taking care of everything and checking up on everybody!</p>

            <h1>3. Theme Parties</h1>
            <p>Whether it’s a halloween blow-out or a denim and diamonds themed shindig, a theme party requires a throughline of action to pull the theme through the entire party.

                Whether that means clip-on earrings and stuffed shoulder parrots for your friends at your pirate party, or including the dress code on your invitations to your lumo party, a theme party typically requires your guests to commit to and immerse themselves in the thematic experience.
                
                Just like with all functions, a theme party can be hard to stay on top of, that’s why it’s advisable to hire a professional.
                
                Not only will a professional event manager be a valuable source of ideas and information that you wouldn’t necessarily have thought of, they’ll take care of all the nitty gritty on the day of, so you can chill out and live your best life as a scarecrow, black cat or pirate at your theme party!</p>

                <h1>4. Wedding Anniversaries</h1>
                <p>Whether a private event for two or two-hundred, a wedding anniversary function is an honour to coordinate.

                    Typically, larger scale wedding anniversary events for milestone anniversaries are sit-down catered affairs with larger guests lists, so that the couple can invite everyone who has played an important role in the longevity and continued happiness of their marriage to celebrate it with them.
                    
                    Whereas, wedding anniversary celebrations for newlyweds typically encompass the coordination of an intimate dinner for two or an escape to a hotel for the weekend.
                    
                    Whether an event on a large or small scale, wedding anniversaries are functions at which attention to detail does not go unnoticed or unappreciated by the married couple and their guests alike.</p>

                    <h1>5. Family Events</h1>
                    <p>Family events could constitute anything from family reunions, to birthday parties, to christenings, and even funerals.

                        If you need to send out an invitation for it, even if you were just planning on sending out a text message, it’s an event, and a professional events manager would love to assist you in the planning and execution thereof.</p>

                        <h1>6. VIP Events</h1>
                        <p>VIP Events are private events as they are not open to the general public and are, by definition, invitation-only.

                            Invitees to VIP events are not, however, necessarily known to one another.
                            
                            Whether a big hospital is hosting a function and inviting their biggest donors, or a university is hosting a Dean’s dinner for top-achieving students, an invitation to a VIP event is reserved for someone who has ranked highly on whatever the system of measurement proves to be for that event.
                            
                            VIP Events can be catered affairs with dinner and dancing, experiential events like invitations to ski-weekends, or resort weekends, or even concert-type events where the primary focus is on the hired entertainer/entertainment.</p>
